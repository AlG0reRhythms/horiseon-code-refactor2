# horiseon-code-refactor2# HORISEON-CODE-REFACTOR

## DESCRIPTION

- We were recently contracted by Horiseon, a social media marketing company, to make their website and code more accessible and readable. We used the scout method, which involves leaving code cleaner than when you found it.

## Installation

- If you're reading this, that means you already have access to the code pushed to git

- However, if it looks like there is something we missed or could improve upon, feel free to clone our repository by clicking the green 'clone' button on the git, and copying the SSH key from the drop down menu. Once you've copied the SSH key you will need to go into your terminal and type 'git clone', paste the key, and hit enter.

  - Congrats! You've successfully made a working directory! This allows you to make alterations/additions to our code on your own local device.

## Credits

- I would like to thank all the teaching staff, my classmates, and Al Gore, without whom none of this would have been possible
